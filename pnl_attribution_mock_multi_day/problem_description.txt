Quant Dev Take-Home Exercise: PnL Attribution Report Generator

You are given:
1. A file of trade executions:
   - timestamp (ISO8601 UTC)
   - strategy (string)
   - symbol (string)
   - side (BUY or SELL)
   - price (float)
   - quantity (int)

2. A file of end-of-day prices:
   - date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - symbol
   - close_price

3. A file of FX rates (EUR/USD):
   - date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - eur_usd (e.g., 1.05)

Tasks:
1. Compute daily PnL per strategy:
   - Realized PnL from executed trades
   - Unrealized PnL from end-of-day price differences
   - FX impact if EUR is involved (assume trades executed in EUR, but PnL is reported in USD)

2. Output a report per strategy per day showing:
   - realized_pnl_usd
   - unrealized_pnl_usd
   - fx_impact_usd
   - total_pnl_usd

Bonus:
- Support any number of strategies and symbols
- Add CLI to run report for a given date
- Include simple unit tests for PnL calculation logic

Constraints:
- Use Python and standard libraries (+ pandas allowed for loading and grouping)
- Write clean, modular code
